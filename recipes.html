                <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

                            <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert.</p>

                    <p>This crispy, gooey, creamy macaroni and cheese is the glorious result of fusing our favorite elements from a few of the top-rated baked macaroni and cheese recipes from our archives.

                    <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>

                            <li>1 lb. dried elbow macaroni</li>
                            <li>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for baking dish</li>
                            <li>6 Tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
                            <li>4 cups whole milk</li>

                    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Melt 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter In a large skillet on the stovetop over medium heat. Add 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, stirring, until butter foam subsides.</li>
                            <li> Add 2 cups panko and 2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped; cook, stirring, until crumbs are golden brown, 4-6 minutes.</li> 
                            <li>Transfer crumbs to a medium bowl, stir in 2 oz. finely grated Parmesan (about ½ cup) and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. plus ⅛ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and set aside.</li>
                            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water, covered, to a boil over high heat. Add 1 lb. dried elbow macaroni and cook, uncovered, until just al dente (avoid overcooking). Drain par-cooked macaroni and set aside (do not rinse).</li>
                            <li>Place rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 400°F. Grease a 13x9” baking dish with unsalted butter.</li>
                            <li>Melt ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter in a large wide pot over medium-low heat. Sprinkle 6 Tbsp. all-purpose flour over butter, whisking to incorporate and make a roux. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until roux is light golden, about 4 minutes. Gradually pour in 4 cups whole milk and ¾ cup heavy cream, whisking constantly to incorporate and make a béchamel sauce. </li>
                            <li>Raise heat to medium-high and bring sauce to a low boil, whisking constantly. Reduce to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook until béchamel sauce is thick and coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes more.</li>
                            <li>Add 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, ½ tsp. ground white pepper, and 1½ Tbsp. mustard powder. Add 16 oz. coarsely grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese (about 6 cups) and 2 oz. grated Parmesan (about ½ cup) in three batches, whisking until each addition is melted before adding more. Remove from heat.</li>
                            <li>Add drained macaroni to pot with cheese sauce and stir well to coat. Transfer macaroni mixture to prepared baking dish and place on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>

                    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.</li> 
                            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.</li>
                            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.</li>
                        </ol>
