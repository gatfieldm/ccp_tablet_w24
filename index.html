        <div>About the creator: 
            <p>Hello, my name is Mason Gatfield. I am a junior studying Data Science through the College of Engineering 
                at the University of Michigan. The website for the College of Engineering can be found at this link: <a href =
                "https://www.engin.umich.edu/">Umich Engineering</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at U of M. My favorite thing to do is attend the football games at the
                Big House. Our team has been incredible while I've been a student, which makes the games much more satisfying.
                Just a couple weeks ago, our team competed and won the CFB National Championship in Houston Texas to cap off a 
                perfect season.
