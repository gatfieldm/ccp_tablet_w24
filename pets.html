            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.<br></p>

            <p>Fitz is a Boston Terrier that enjoys chasing tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Fitz is often found sitting by the fire in wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He's energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.</p>
            <p>Fitz loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn't get a snack.<br></p>

            <h2>Toby</h2>

            <img class="center-image" src = "images/toby_spread.jpeg" alt = "Toby lounging on a sofa looking into the distance">

            <p> Toby is a cute shihtzu-yorkie mix that was adopted in 2016. Toby is selective with people, and it is a great sign when he seems to like you. Although small, Toby asserts his dominance through barking to garner attention. He believes he is an untouchable guard dog. Regardless, Toby reserves his cute side to those he loves.</p>
            <p>Toby enjoys looking out windows more than anything else. The wooded area surrounding the house allows for many deer to pass through. If Toby catches the slightest glance at a family of deer, be prepared to plug your ears. He will start barking, and seems to never stop. What he doesn't know is his owners can also see the deer and don't recognize them as a threat. As a result, his owners are forced to not make it obvious if they see any animals outside.<br></p>
